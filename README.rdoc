= Bespin on Rails

Bespin on Rails is a simple Ruby on Rails plugin that allows you to embed the Mozilla
Bespin code editor component in your Rails views using simple helper tags.

Bespin is a Mozilla Labs experiment on how to build an extensible Web code
editor using HTML 5 technology.

This plugin comes bundled with Bespin (head version 2009/04/27). To learn more
about Bespin have a look at their Labs site at http://labs.mozilla.com/projects/bespin. 
Please report any issue with the editor on their issue tracker.

There is also an unofficial Bespin mirror on GitHub at http://github.com/bespin/bespin.

== Requirements

You need at least Rails 2.3 for this plugin. To make the bundled resources
available in your applications public folder the plugin will create a symlink
from your applications public folder to the plugins public folder. This is
currently done using the 'ln' unix command. As a result the plugin won't
work on Windows.

To work around this you can manually copy all files from vendor/plugins/bespin-on-rails/public
to public/_plugins/bespin-on-rails.

You need a browser that is able to work with Mozilla Bespin. Safari 4 (beta) and 
Mozilla Firefox 3.0.9 are fine.

== Installation

Download the plugin from http://github.com/provideal/bespin-on-rails and install
it in vendor/plugins/bespin-on-rails.

We will provide a gem based installation in the next release.

== Usage

In your application layout (typically somewhere below <%= javascript_include_tag(:defaults) %>)

  ...
  <%= bespin_include_tag %>
  ...

In your views (example form)

  <% form_tag ... do %>
    ...
    <%= bespin_editor_tag :content, '<div>some html snippet</div>', :editor_style => 'height: 600px', :language => 'html' %>
  <% end %>
